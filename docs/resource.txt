TDX is built using a combination of VMX & MKTME technology, and a CPU-attested, software module, as shown in the figure below. 
Intel TDX solution can provide the following capabilities to TDs:

Memory and CPU state confidentiality and integrity to help keep the sensitive IP and workload data secure from most software-based attacks and many hardware-based attacks.

Remote attestation enables a relying party (either the owner of the workload or a user of the services provided by the workload) to establish trustworthiness prior to providing that workload data.

Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX) is introducing new, architectural elements to help deploy hardware-isolated, virtual machines (VMs) called trust domains (TDs). Intel TDX is designed to isolate VMs from the virtual-machine manager (VMM)/hypervisor and any other non-TD software on the platform to protect TDs from a broad range of software. These hardware-isolated TDs include:

Secure-Arbitration Mode (SEAM) – a new mode of the CPU designed to host an Intel-provided, digitally-signed, security-services module called the Intel TDX module.
Shared bit in GPA to help allow TD to access shared memory.
Secure EPT to help translate private GPA to provide address-translation integrity and to prevent TD-code fetches from shared memory. Encryption and integrity protection of private-memory access using a TD-private key is the goal.
Physical-address-metadata table (PAMT) to help track page allocation, page initialization, and TLB consistency.
Multi-key, total-memory-encryption (MKTME) engine designed to provide memory encryption using AES-128- XTS and integrity using 28-bit MAC and a TD-ownership bit.
Remote attestation designed to provide evidence of TD executing on a genuine, Intel TDX system and its TCB version.
